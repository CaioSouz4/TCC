abstract="Effective communication is important to successful software development, but it is difficult to achieve. We believe transparency --- the visibility of information to stakeholders --- is an important factor in the effectiveness of communication in software projects. We theorise that more effective communication results from more transparent requirements documents. To test our theory, we conducted an experiment. We developed an operational definition of transparency with three attributes: accessibility, understandability, and relevance. We had students and software practitioners use requirements documents of differing levels of transparency based on these attributes to answer questions. We found that participants with the more transparent document spent less time, answered more questions correctly, and were more confident about their answers, than participants with the less transparent document. The results of our experiment provide evidence that our view of transparency may help evaluate the effectiveness of documents as a form of communication. Further work is needed to reproduce our results, and to determine whether they are generalizable to other types of stakeholders and forms of communication.",

Several industries developing products on a large-scale are facing major challenges as their products are becoming more and more software-intensive. Whereas software was once considered a detail to be bundled, it has since become an intricate and interdependent part of most products. The advancement of software increases the uncertainty and the interdependencies between development tasks and artifacts. A key success factor is good requirements engineering (RE), and in particular, the challenges of effectively and efficiently coordinating and communicating requirements.
Objective
In this work we present a lightweight RE framework and demonstrate and evaluate its industrial applicability in response to the needs of a Swedish automotive company for improving specific problems in inter-departmental requirements coordination and communication in large-scale development of software-intensive systems.
Method
A case study approach and a dynamic validation were used to develop and evaluate the framework in close collaboration with our industrial partner, involving three real-life cases in an ongoing car project. Experience and feedback were collected through observations when applying the framework and from 10 senior industry professionals in a questionnaire and in-depth follow-up interviews.
Results
The experience and feedback about using the framework revealed that it is relevant and applicable for the industry as well as a useful and efficient way to resolve real problems in coordinating and communicating requirements identified at the case company. However, other concerns, such as accessibility to necessary resources and competences in the early development phases, were identified when using the method, which allowed for earlier pre-emptive action to be taken.
Conclusion
Overall, the experience from using the framework and the positive feedback from industry professionals indicated a feasible framework that is applicable in the industry for improving problems related to coordination and communication of requirements. Based on the promising results, our industrial partner has decided upon further validations of the framework in a large-scale pilot program."

abstract="Requirements communication plays a vital role in development projects in coordinating the customers, the business roles and the software engineers. Communication gaps represent a significant source of project failures and overruns. For example, misunderstood or uncommunicated requirements can lead to software that does not meet the customers' requirements, and subsequent low number of sales or additional cost required to redo the implementation. We propose that requirements engineering (RE) distance measures are useful for locating gaps in requirements communication and for improving on development practice. In this paper, we present a case study of one software development project to evaluate this proposition. Thirteen RE distances were measured including geographical and cognitive distances between project members, and semantic distances between requirements and testing artefacts. The findings confirm that RE distances impact requirements communication and project coordination. Furthermore, the concept of distances was found to enable constructive group reflection on communication gaps and improvements to development practices. The insights reported in this paper can provide practitioners with an increased awareness of distances and their impact. Furthermore, the results provide a stepping stone for further research into RE distances and methods for improving on software development processes and practices.",

To optimize the requirements definition process we present a model that the trust management process is integrated into the requirements definition process, as measures to minimize the gap between requirements caused due to a lack or discrepancy in communication that is produced easily in requirements definition and to use a negotiation method for solving problems in the following processes provided by the gap between requirements including tacit ones. We discuss a matter that building trust between the stakeholders in the requirements definition process is effective to optimize the requirements definition, which has been produced by the special characteristics of Japanese firms in the information system development, and we also describe the necessity and effectiveness of information system in Japan."

abstract = "Requirements definition that is an important work process for a project and may determine the success or failure of system development project tends to draw an ambiguous conclusion, which will lead directly to the failure of such a system construction. To optimize the requirements definition process we present a model that the trust management process is integrated into the requirements definition process, as measures to minimize the gap between requirements caused due to a lack or discrepancy in communication that is produced easily in requirements definition and to use a negotiation method for solving problems in the following processes provided by the gap between requirements including tacit ones. We discuss a matter that building trust between the stakeholders in the requirements definition process is effective to optimize the requirements definition, which has been produced by the special characteristics of Japanese firms in the information system development, and we also describe the necessity and effectiveness of information system in Japan."
